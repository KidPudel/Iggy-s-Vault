**Distributed** [[Task queue]], which is for asynchronously executing tasks on the side in the real-time (could be scheduled), to take off the weight of waiting for something to be done by distributing to someone else.
So the worker will response as it is done, while client that is requested, not waiting for it.
Celery uses [[message broker]] implicitly
