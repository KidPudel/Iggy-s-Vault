Odin in a lot of aspects is kind of an "offshoot"of Golang, they are extremely similar, but without a [[garbage collector]].
C feel and control, but better, smarter, so Odin when you write and love Golang, but you don't want garbage collector.

So Odin is like a child of C and Golang: it inherits the appearance of its father (Golang), while adopting low-level nature of its mother (C)
