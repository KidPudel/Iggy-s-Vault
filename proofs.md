# Inductive proof

> One way to proof that the algorithm works

Inductive proof has _**base case**_ and _**inductive case**_

Example:

Proof that i can climb to the top of the ladder.

**Base case:** I’m at the 1st rung

**Inductive case:** If i can climb to the k’st rung ⇒ i can climb k’st + 1 rung ⇒ 1 → 2 → 3 → …

**Therefore:** I can climb to the top of the ladder by one rung each time
