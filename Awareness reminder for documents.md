How to balance the convenience and honest learning?
Don't delegate the job of exploring and coming to solutions to someone else (like AI). Do it for yourself. Instead you can utilize sparingly two things, but at different stages of learning:
1. post-struggle — teachings and crystalized truths on best decisions. Because after you've struggled (been a beginner and progressed through fighting), you understand the struggles, so you understand solutions now.
2. pre-struggle *for experienced* — context building. This way it allows for more efficient way to utilize what you've already build.

Everything else like pre-struggle solution references, are just harmful and overwhelming.

## Example illustrating Why pre-struggle for experienced Works Without Breaking Rules

Because they doesn't solve _your specific game problems_. It explains tools. Compare:

**Bad (Components Reference):**

```csharp
// "Use CharacterController for FPS movement"
controller.Move(velocity * Time.deltaTime);
```

→ You copy-paste before understanding velocity, deltaTime, or why they multiply.

**Good (C# Reference):**

```
// "String interpolation exists because concatenation is verbose"
// Old: "Player " + name + " has " + score
// New: $"Player {name} has {score}"
```

You understand _why_ the feature exists, then apply it when you encounter verbose concatenation in your code.

# Test: Am I experienced enough for pre-struggle context?

- [ ] Can I explain why this tool exists and what problem it solves _before_ looking at the reference?
- [ ] Have I already used 3+ similar tools in this domain successfully?
- [ ] Am I looking for efficiency (faster recall) or learning (first exposure)?

If you answer "learning" or can't explain the tool category's purpose, you're not experienced enough. Use post-struggle resources instead.
