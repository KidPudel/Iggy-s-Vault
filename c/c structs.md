[[Structures]] in C could be declared with [[new type or when to create class]] definition and without, but with type definition is the best practices, which allows:
- Reusability
- Clarity
- Type Safety
- Modularity 

struct tags
this approach will *give a name to the struct type itself*

typedef naming
this will create an alias, a brand new type
