Correct breathing can improve your mental health, physical health as well as concentration and cognitive abilities 

Like by having this feature of controlling breathing, we can change our state of mind (eg help study or sleep)

Breathing with your nose - you consume more oxygen, because of more resistance, so you activate your muscles 

Corbin dioxide delivers oxygen to the cells 

To much CD in the air can lead to the panic attacks even with people who had their amigdola 

If to low CD → PH is gets higher and more oxygen gets available to the cells and tissues 

When exhale CD from blood stream goes to the lungs and then breaths out

## Pre-Bötzinger complex

There is an area in the brain that controls our rhythmic processes like breathing even when we are not conscious (opium can shutdown this system)

Other brain canter through phrenic nerve that is not rhythmic, like box breathing

Hyperventilation creates a noise because of lack of carbon dioxide, we become more anxious and increase of seizure, because sensors cant get above the noise 

Deliberate breathing practices, Box breathing and higher tolerance to carbon dioxide can lower chance of over-breathing and under-breathing, improve mood regulation and sleep and focus

Meditation improve focus and memory, not so much reduction of stress 

**Cyclic sighing** (deeply inhale, inhale once more, and exhale through your mouth) proved by study that it is the most efficient way to reduce stress, improve mood and sleep

Over-breathing vs under breathing (hyperventilation) 

1. To much breath (not enough carbon dioxide) which not allows oxygen to reach the cells and tissues
2. Hypertension is shallow breathing, which not allows to satisfy your body’s needs

When inhale - diaphragm gets down, which allows lungs for more space, and as consequence heart gets bigger (more blood in it) and blood flows slower, which signals to spreed up the heart rate, the opposite to that is also true

That way we can control our heart rate

spasm of Phrenic nerve (диафрагмальный нерв) cause hick ups , cus it’s connected (kind of in control of it and gives some signals) with diaphragm and lungs liver

**controls your diaphragm** (the large dome-shaped muscle between your abdominal and chest cavities). It's essential to breathing. Your nerve sends signals that cause your diaphragm to contract (become thicker and flatter).

Technique that takes advantage of hypercontacting phrenic nerve, so it relax it and releaves spasms: inhale 3 times in a row through a nose as deep as possible, then wait for 15-20 seconds and slowly exhale (through the nose pr mouth)

---

We breath because neurones detect high level of carbon dioxide in blood stream 

---

Cyclic hyperventilation can cause stress and release adrenaline because of lack of carbon dioxide which triggers breathing (so you can practice to handle yourself in stressful situations)

---

Controlling (forcing) rhythmic breathing in stressful situations especially emphasizing on exhales will calm you down and make you more aware, it translates to all stressful situations 

---

Nose breathing improves facial aesthetic

When you inhale puple gets bigger, exhale gets smaller 

When inhale, reaction to things that happens around us gets significantly better

Your ability to remember things, especially that takes effort to remember and ability to learn new information gets significantly greater compared to exhale

Why?

Because of olfactory system, the most ancient system to detect chemicals in our surroundings, and in order to get it to our brain, we need to inhale

exhalations are passive, so it allows for more enhanced doing voluntery movement, so in martial arts you exhale

---

Nasal breathing gas natro oxide cause relaxation smooth masculateure that relate to vascular system of all teasys of your body - great to relate contetion → breathing though your nose allow some diolatuon of a vasculature more blood flow diolation of nasal passages → natro oxide to all teasuses of body and dialtiob of small capilaries that intervate all organ of the body allow delivery of more nutritions and remove carbon dioxide and waste products from tissue

study with two twins one nasal one breathing aesthetic changes mouth entire jaw structure changes in non favorable aesthetic way, fortunately when switching to nose breathing with exercises by default, aesthetic changes are very dramatic and very favourable, eyebrows are elevated, chickbones, sharpening of the jaw and most notably improvements of the teeth and entire jaw structure 

Test is to close your mouth and put your tongue at the roof of the mouth and breath through your nose
