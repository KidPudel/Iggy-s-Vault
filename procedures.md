In Odin procedures are just functions and general naming conventions are `verb_noun`, just like in C

They operate, executed just to work with data
[[all computer can do (programming)]]

they also support default value
```odin
foo :: proc(x: int, b := false) {}
```


constant procedure, the second main character in CS world after data
