**Frame**/Screen/Video [[buffer]] is the collection of bound [[image buffers]] (memory chunks) **to which we perform drawing operations** on the GPU.
For that you use shader programs ([[vertex shader]] and [[fragment shader]]). And shader program needs to know into which chunk they will draw, aka into which image.


"So far we've used several types of screen buffers: a color buffer for writing color values, a depth buffer to write and test depth information, and finally a stencil buffer that allows us to discard certain fragments based on some condition. The combination of these buffers is stored somewhere in GPU memory and is called aÂ framebuffer."


So it could be a rendering target.
