- CollisionShape2D: node that engine uses to actually capture the collision data. It does not do anything on its own. It is a component for other nodes to use.
- Area2D: node that has the right set of functionality to detect/notice, when collision is happening via CollisionShape2D. Detector/Sniffer. NOTE: without physics/collision
- RayCast2D: node that is used to find the first CollisionObject2D (with which masks) it intersects with its rays.
- CharacterBody2D: node that exposes physics functionality, which is the ability to move, and collide by exposing CollisionShape2D data.
- Control: Base class for all GUI elements. Adjusts its position and size based on its parent control
- Subviewport: [[viewport in godot]] separate render target
	- For example you can render a whole different window in it and set its texture to the texture of TextureRect node and render it as a flat texture
- AnimationTree: Blending

- AnimationPlayer: Animating any property
- MeshInstance2D: because of the nature of the shape allows to place the shader as on the ColorRect surface in 2D
- SpringArm3D: ray casting node that moves all of its children to the nearest collision point. Commonly used in combination with Camera3D to move it in a narrow space
