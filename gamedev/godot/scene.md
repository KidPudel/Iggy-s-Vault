Scene is a collection of [[node in godot]]s, saved as a ***[[resource]]***.

NOTE: the difference between instantiating a class `.new()` and instantiating a scene `.instantiate()`, is that first is just create a fresh instance of a class and nothing more, while the second creates a fresh instance of the resource, meaning bringing all hierarchy of the scene.
