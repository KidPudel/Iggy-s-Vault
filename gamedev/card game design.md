The C. A. R. D. S. model of Card Games, that helps structure card game design to easier to define the system

The following 5 categories has different categories to consider in itself, and they could be mixed or leaning towards one or strictly doing one of these

# Collection
How players obtains cards
1. Starter pack, randomized or not
2. In-Run collection
	1. rewards in duels defeating bosses
3. Meta-progression
	1. Unlocked pack outside lookof a card game itself
		1. Solving puzzles
	2. Real meta-progression with unlocking cards between games (whole (video) game)

# Aim
The ultimate goal of the game.
> NOTE: It is important to let the player know how to win a game **ASAP**.

Two categories that could be done in many different ways:
1. Value to Defend (The most common): Health points (hp < 0 = you lose)
	1. Leader you need to defend
	2. Amount of cards
2. Value to Obtain: Victory points (VP) >= target = you win
Usually you have **one main** win condition, but you can have several

# How to get there
Aim is not only end destination, but also how to get there.
Road to the victory needs to be engaging (like every aspect), so one of the ways to introduce that is Deckbuilding, which by itself introduced the spectrum to define like traits, strategies, archetypes


# Resources
**Economy** of a game
Two categories:
1. Price tag: Any type of currency like mana or energy, that gives the ability to play card or card effect
2. Terms & conditions: Restriction by forcing to meet certain requirement like discarding a card (sacrifice) or having specific card in play. No restriction (like meet condition outside of the card game, like quick draw something)
> NOTE: these categories by itself can be divided different variations

Economy needs balance
- Which power level comes at which cost?
- Manage power creep

# Deployment
Deployment is the core game loop of the game. This defines the flow (setup and structure) of the game
## Where player can play the cards?
We need to define/design the layout of the playing field which includes zones like
- Deck
- Hand
- Playing field
- Discard Pile
- Removed from play
- Card type Specific zone

## When player can play the cards?
- Turns
	- One action
	- As many as can
- Phases
	- Beginning phase (layout)
	- Main phase (play cards)
	- Combat (interact)
	- End (resolution)
- Rounds for natural refresh state



# Struggle
Category about player interaction
## Combat
- Attack system
- Blocking
- Combat tricks
- Damage calculation

## Response
- Counter
- Reaction
- Stack/Chain
- Bluff
