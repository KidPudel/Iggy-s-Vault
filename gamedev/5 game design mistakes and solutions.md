top for the board game designers, but it is true for games in general.

# 1. Lack of Clear Vision / Scope Creep
- **The Mistake:** Getting carried away by inspiration from other games and adding too many mechanics (e.g., worker placement, deck building, modular maps, engine building) without a cohesive vision. This leads to a bloated and unfocused game.
- **The Solution:**
    - **Define: Theme & Concept:** Identify the essential theme, story, setting, and the emotions or experiences you want players to have.
    - **Make a GDD (Game Design Document):** Write down all thoughts, ideas, and goals for your game to establish a clear foundation.

# 2. Being Defensive of Unbalanced Mechanics
- **The Mistake:** Becoming so excited and proud of a mechanic or system you devised that you defend it when playtesters point out it is unbalanced or ***ruins the fun***.
- **The Solution:**
    - **Put yourself in your players' shoes:** Recognize that unbalanced mechanics—or even the feeling of imbalance—can ruin the experience.
    - **Remove unbalanced mechanics:** Listen to playtesters' pain points and remove unbalanced mechanics wherever you find them.

# 3. Overcomplicated Rules
- **The Mistake:** Creating a game where things are "needlessly convoluted" or where the rule exceptions are excessive, forcing players to constantly reference a rulebook glossary just to play.
- **The Solution:**
    - **Aim for Elegant Solutions:** Simplify wherever possible by removing redundant mechanics and excessive rule exceptions. Aim for solutions that solve multiple problems simultaneously (the "two birds with one stone" concept) to create a tight and focused experience.

# 4. Neglecting Market Viability and Differentiation
- **The Mistake:** Making a game that is fine or even well-designed, but is ultimately "nothing special" or memorable, causing it to collect dust on a shelf. Without market viability and differentiation, a great game can still fail.
- **The Solution:** **(Implied)** Ensure your game offers something unique such as:
    - Unique Components
    - Unique Mechanics
    - Unique Spectacle


# 5 Not playtesting your game enough. The Number One Cardinal Sin

The biggest mistake a board game designer can make, which also solves all of the previous issues.

Playtesting is crucial because it will help you:
1. Discover your lack of clear vision.
2. Notice and remove unbalanced mechanics.
3. Find elegant solutions to over complicated rules.
4. Learn if your game can succeed (market viability).

**The Process**
- PLAYTEST
- TAKE NOTES
- MAKE CHANGES
-  REPEAT

> Play your game as often as you can with a diverse group of people.
