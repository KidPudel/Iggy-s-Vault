simple direct media, library which goal is to abstract every aspect of [[multimedia]].
It is trying to be cross-platform, therefore in terms of graphical capabilities, it has only limited functionality to be available in every platform.
Meaning it is not just about building games, it is for building cross-platform programs.
It is a lower level than raylib, but still higher level that you don't interact with the meaningless layers of graphics apis etc
But still exposes you to the real world, so you aware of how it works and why, allowing you to gain a deep knowledge.
And high level enough to allow you to be more focused on engineering and actual problem solving.

Result: Low level enough to customize the flow, and gaining insights and understanding of deep knowledge, yet high level enough to not focus on meaningless layers of standards (if you don't want to be an EXPERT in graphical ins and outs), and focus on problem solving and engineering, and accomplish projects by actually building cool software.

The main point that there are a lot of libraries, and they has different focus, and the nature of being a collection of independent blocks, allows you to blend them, for example use everything from SDL3 and use graphic rendering part from sokol.
and extensibility by other APIs like OpenGL, Vulkan or libraries like sokol and bgfx.

Raylib is easy to get started but once the project gets a little complex it bites back. SDL on the other hand takes more time to setup everything but scales extremely well as the project gets bigger and bigger. Also, SDL is exceptionally well written code.


SDL might be more than enough for a lot of 3D graphical interfaces.
