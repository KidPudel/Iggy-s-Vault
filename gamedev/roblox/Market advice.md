**Practical Advice:**

- **Use existing frameworks** — Don't build from scratch. There are open-source tycoon, simulator, and combat frameworks on GitHub and the Roblox toolbox
- **Monetization from day 1** — Game passes for 2x resources, skip timers, cosmetics. Roblox players expect this
- **Thumbnail/icon matters more than you think** — Clickbait works on the platform
- **Update publicly** — Even fake "UPDATE 2!" in the title boosts visibility
