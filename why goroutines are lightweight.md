- Goroutines are managed by [[golang scheduler]], this makes it optimized on a system
- Goroutines are using [[segmented stack in go]], which lets them to start small and grow/shrink
- They are share memory ([[concurrency in go]]), which reduces memory usage and context switch time
- Goroutine yield control at well-defined points via channel operations and function calls ([[concurrency in go]]). Which makes it predictable and efficient scheduling behavior. Cooperative scheduling.
