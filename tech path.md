> Currently i work as a mobile-full stack developer (meaning flutter, with additional tasks like API creation) i live and work in Moscow, but I really want to move to other country and get a remote job as a backend developer. Can you be my mentor here, be honest and give me advice on what should i focus? Maybe golang is not that important and it’s better to do more backend (to practice in a craft) and game dev (to practice more programming) since python is more for rapid development or maybe i should focus more on golang and do game dev with golang and so on???

Based on the information you provided, here's my ***honest advice***:

Since your goal is to transition into a remote backend developer role, I would recommend **focusing more on backend development skills rather than game development**, at least in the short term.

**Go is the must have as a _valuable_ _addition_** to your skillset, as it's gaining popularity for building efficient and concurrent backend systems. However, **mastering a more widely-used backend language** like Python might **give you an edge** when applying for remote backend developer positions.


Here's what I would suggest:
1. **Focus on Backend Development**: Spend a significant portion of your time learning and practicing backend development concepts, such as building RESTful APIs, working with databases, implementing authentication and authorization, handling concurrency and scalability, and deploying server-side applications.
2. **Choose a Primary Backend Language**: Pick a language that is widely used for backend development, such as Java, ***Python***. **Become proficient** in that language, its frameworks, and its ecosystem.
3. **Learn Go as a Secondary Language with Game development**: Go is particularly useful for building high-performance, concurrent systems, and it's becoming more popular in the backend development world. game development can be an excellent way to practice programming in ***Go***. This can be particularly useful if you're interested in learning more about memory management, concurrency, and low-level programming concepts that Go excels at.


> Okay, I’ll prioritize backend and Full-stack projects using Python, and on a side when making games for fun and for my spirit I’ll do it in Golang, to further strengthen my secondary language, so if the day comes when they will ask me about an experience in go specifically, i could show accomplished game projects

That's an excellent approach! Prioritizing backend and full-stack projects in Python will allow you to build a ***strong portfolio*** and demonstrate your proficiency in your primary language for remote backend developer roles. At the same time, using Golang for game development as a side project will give you a solid foundation and portfolio in Go should opportunities arise that specifically demand Go experience.

_A lot of backend jobs want Python as the main language, and Golang as the must have additional tool to have_

About python and go:
I strongly suggest you learn both. Every developer needs to gain skills in a minimum of two languages imo. Learning the differences helps you understand each more intimately.
