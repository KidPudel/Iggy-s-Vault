fuzzy finder
```zsh
brew install fzf
```

default `fzf` command lets you search for files in a directory and prints it on pick
```
fzf
```

we can also preview
```zsh
fzf --preview "cat {}" # bring to the {} file
```
```zsh
fzf --preview "bat --color=always {}" # bring to the {} file
```


we can also combine it with nvim feature of `nvim <name_of_file>` to open
```zsh
nvim $(fzf --preview "bat --color=always {}") # bring to the {} file
```

this will make us super productive by allowing to search and edit almost at the speed of light
> perfect time for aliasing


# autocomplete
```
cd ~/dotfiles/**
```
will trigger fzf to autocomplete path

```zsh
kill -9 **
```
this will fzf for processes

# key bindings

Firstly to use them, we need to set up shell integration
- bash
    
    ```shell
    # Set up fzf key bindings and fuzzy completion
    eval "$(fzf --bash)"
    ```
    
- zsh
    
    ```shell
    # Set up fzf key bindings and fuzzy completion
    source <(fzf --zsh)
    ```
    
- fish
    
    ```fish
    # Set up fzf key bindings
    fzf --fish | source
    ```
