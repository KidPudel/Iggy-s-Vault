- middle mouse for rotating around
	- ctrl+middle: zoom in and out
	- shift+middle: move around
	- alt/option+middle mouse: clip the view to axis
- x: 
	- object mode: delete object
	- edit mode: delete vertex, edge, face
- shift+a: add. just like in godot cmd+a
- shift+d: duplicate an object
- g: grab the object
	- esc/right click: cancel the movement:
	- left click: accept
	- x, y, z: for moving along the chosen axis
		- shift + axis: to exclude axis
	- middle mouse: snap to the nearest axis
	- control: snap to grids (move by 1 meter)
- e: extrude creates a new connected geometry from selected elements ([[vertex]], [[edge]], [[faces]]) in a direction, usually normal to the selection
	- alt+e: special extrude options
- f12: take a photo/render
- n: properties of the selected object. Location, scale, rotation, plugin panels. we can notice here if we forgotten to [[blender apply]] to [[bake]] some transformation
- t: tool selection
- s: scale
	- supports scaling along axis (could be used in any mode)
	- use shift with transformations to make it slower, hence accurate
	- s+x+0: aligns selected (makes all of them 0 at x)
	- alt+s: resets
- r: rotate
	- You can also use numbers to rotate at precise degree 
	- alt+r: resets
- z: change shading (viewport, material preview, wireframe)
	- shift-z: switch between 2 latest
- ctrl+tab: switch between interaction modes (object, editing, sculpting, etc)
	- tab: to switch between 2 latest
	- in timeline to go into graph view
- 1, 2, 3:
	- in edit mode:
		- switch between selection modes (vertices, edges, faces)
- p: in edit mode separate selection into a new mesh
- w: change selection mode: rectangle, circle, lasso
- f9: parameters of the object that are appeared when you create a new object
- right click: commonly used commands on a selected item
	- set origins etc
- cmd+1: adds a subdivision surface modified. (which splits [[faces]] into smaller parts, making it appear smoother exponentially)
- o: proportional editing: allows to edit along inside the area
	- scroll to increase or decrease the influence area
- alt+left click: edge select, which will select whole edge of connected vertices [[vertex]]
	- with `shift`: selects more
- f2: rename object
- f3: search for action and shortcut 
- shift+tab: enable snap during transform. can be enabled with different targets
- h: hide
	- alt+h: unhide
- f: 
	- sculpt mode:
		- change the size of a brush in sculpting
		- shift+f: change the strength of a brush
	- edit mode: fill at edge with face
- ctrl+i: invert something like mask brush effect, to paint only on originally masked area
- shift: invokes smooth brush type in any brush type
- ctrl+p: assign (1) child object to the (2) parent object
- /: isolation mode toggle
- ctrl+a: [[blender apply]] menu
- a: select all (like all faces or all meshes)
- u: uv mapping setting
- ctrl+b: in edit mode. Performs a **bevel** (chamfer) on selected **edges or vertices**. Splits the geometry ([[vertex]], [[edge]]) and inserts new edges, to soften or round edges
	- ![[Pasted image 20250728120935.png|500]] example
	- ctrl+shift+b: bevel the vertex
- ctrl+r: loop cut mesh new loop, which creates new vertices, new [[topology]], so you can edit it more
- k: knife cuts new [[topology]]
- alt+z: x-ray
- m: 
	- in object: move to new collection
	- in edit: merge vertices
- ctrl+j: join to the active object (yellow one)
	- 2 objects needs to be joined to perform bridge edge loops
- shift+right click: move 3D cursor, this allows to make it origin in some operations
- ctrl+l: links transfer data to the other selected objects from the target. (like modifiers)
- j: join vertices to create new edge
- g+g: grab and drag vertex along the edge
- ctrl+mouse select: deselects
- alt+a: select all
	- l: linked selection
	- alt+a: deselects all
- i: insert a key frame
- cmd+alt+s: incremental save
- q: quick actions
- .: choose transform pivot point
- t: in graph editor choose interpolation mode
- shift+e: adds a F-curve extrapolation like cyclic animation
- "\`": view options like focus on selected object
- shift+s: snap options (like move cursor to selected objects )
- alt+n: normals setting (like flipping normals to see inside instead of outside)
