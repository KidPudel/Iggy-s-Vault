Static [[RAM]] that is much faster and more energy hungry compared to [[DRAM]] that does not requires refresh (hence static), because of how it stores data in [[flip-flops]], **(typically 6 transistors per bit)** instead of [[capacitors]].
So as long as power is applied, it **retains its value** without needing to be refreshed.
**SRAM takes ~5–6× more die area per bit than [[DRAM]]**.


- **SRAM constantly burns power** to hold values (active inverters).
- **[[DRAM]] only uses power when refreshing**, and refresh can be optimized or staggere
