sync.Map:

- Concurrent map for key-value storage
- Safe for multiple goroutines without additional locking
- Optimized for scenarios with many reads and few writes
- Useful for caches, shared state, or metadata storage

sync.Pool:

- Temporary object pool to reduce allocation overhead
- Reuses objects to minimize garbage collection pressure
- Ideal for frequently created and destroyed objects
- Commonly used for buffers, connection pools, or temporary structs

Key differences:

1. Purpose: Map is for storage, Pool is for object reuse
2. Concurrency: Map is inherently concurrent, Pool requires careful use
3. Performance: Map optimizes concurrent access, Pool reduces allocations
