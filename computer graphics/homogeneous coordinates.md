by introducing in 2D third or in 3D forth element `w` to the object coordinates, **we making the room** for the [[transformations]] matrices to change the origin of the object
where in the main coordinates (x, y, optionally z) we operate with matrix's x, y to do the main transformation, and then to translation or change of the origin with the w element

> QUICK NOTE: [[matrix multiplication]]

and now, after introducing `w`, we have more room in a single [[transformations]] matrix, so that after transformation, we can translate!
