Instancing is technique that allows to draw multiple copies of the same data (**whole references of vertex buffer**) with n times with for example n different transformations in a single draw call.

we can have vertex buffer that only stores one type of quad, and instancing it and then change it with [[transformations]]


where [[indices]] is for referencing vertices, instancing references whole geometries like meshes with all their [[vertex]]ies and [[indices]].
