Shader is a program that runs on GPU.
The main purpose of shader is:
- process how vertices are positioned and transformed
- Determine how textures are mapped and displayed on the geometry 
- calculate light
- Apply effects 

So the 3d model or 2d texture is a collection of vertices, and shaders are for making this data interactive?
