In math we can calculate it in several ways
## 1. Standard formula
$$a⋅b=∣a∣∣b∣cos⁡(θ)\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = | \mathbf{a} | | \mathbf{b} | \cos(\theta)$$

## 2. Projection formula
We can [[project vector]] a into b, and multiply the length of projection by the [[magnitude]] of b vector
`dot product = length of projected a * length of b`

$$\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \text{(length of the projection of } \mathbf{a} \text{ onto } \mathbf{b} \text{)} \times | \mathbf{b} |$$
This is true because projection of a onto b equals [[magnitude]] of a vector multiplied by cos between 2 vectors
$$\text{Projection of } \mathbf{a} \text{ onto } \mathbf{b} = | \mathbf{a} | \cos(\theta)$$

## 3. Component-wise operation (most common)

To calculate dot product, we multiply each element by seconds vector element and calculating the sum

Calculating dot product is a fundamental operation in vector math to reveal important information about their relationship, like:
- relation of 2 vector's directions / how it aligns with another vecor
	- negative value: opposite direction
	- positive value: same direction
	- 0 value: perpendicular
