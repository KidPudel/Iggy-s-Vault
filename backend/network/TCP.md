TCP/IP Transmission Control Protocol

TCP uses [[three-way handshake]] to establish connection, that is [[full duplex]]


TCP **chops data** into a [[packets]] and sends them over individually, by the quickest allowed routs, as well as attaching header with instructions to compose it back, and **if some package gets lost, we call it again to get missing packages** (unlike [[UDP]]).
