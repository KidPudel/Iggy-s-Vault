Distributed decentralized network of computers (software) that is responsible for handling trading of anything without a middle man, by running the same operation on each computer and using mechanism like cryptography to secure the transactions

For example, in Web 2.0, sites are centralized, because website is served on its own servers, in Web 3.0, we have blockchain, which allows a website to "live" across many servers independent, and therefore not being owned by one particular side.

So blockchain is made of many individual computers, that maintain one shared record of data (one action) which is commonly referred to as a "ledger".

Blocks in blockchain is a shared data grouped into a blocks and appended to to the end sequentially like a chain.
Each block is come from [[nodes in blockchain]] interacting with a blockchain network, which will result in a new block chained.
But before they must reach consensus about the state of network (who owns assets and who sends crypto to who) and then they must communicate together about new blocks of data, and verify their authenticity by one node broadcasting a block, and it will be obvious if transactions had been altered. Then they must work together to add new blocks to the blockchain.
if one breaks, it will disrupt the entire chain.

Once a set of transactions are grouped into a block, the sum of data is hashed ([[hashing]]), to calculate the transaction ID.
