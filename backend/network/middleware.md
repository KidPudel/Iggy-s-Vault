Middleware in a backend server is a **bridge**, between incoming request and final response handler

In a backend server, middleware functions can perform tasks like:
- Logging the request details
- Parsing request bodies
- Validating user authentication and authorization
- Adding response headers
- Handling CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
- Error handling
