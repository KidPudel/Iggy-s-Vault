UDP/IP - User Datagram Protocol

UDP unlike [[TCP]] is a [[connectionless protocol]], it speeds up communications by **not formally establishing a connection before data is transferred**,
but this results in a risk of [[packets]] (in UDP, called "*datagrams*") to become lost in transit, and also creates an opportunity for  exploitation in the form of [[DDoS attacks]]


UDP does the same as [[TCP]], but it doesn't verify its integrity, which makes it faster (perfect for games)
