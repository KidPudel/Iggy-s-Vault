best practices
- path parameters, that are part of a path itself are used to *identify specific resource*, separated by `/`,
	- it clearly defines a hierarchical relationship
	- clean and intuitive
	-  Example: `https://example.com/users/123`
- query parameters are optional and used to *pass additional data or filter the resource* separated by `?` assigned with `=` and from second parameter are separated by `&`
	- Example `https://example.com/search?q=keyword&sortBy=date&page=2`
