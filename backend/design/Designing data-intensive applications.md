There are data-intensive and computer-intensive applications.
In data-intensive applications important things are the amount. complexity and the speed at which data is changing.
3 main aspects of dta is:
- Reliability
- Scalability
- Maintainability

# Reliability
Is the idea to be fault-prove as possible
Designing the system to tolerate hardware faults and human errors
Making a system work even if some fault is happened, hardware, software or human
There is a theory: [[CAP]]

# Scalability
The idea to maintain performance and availability when load is increases
Designing the system to keep up with the increate of the data load
Scaling system is done through [[vertical scaling]] or [[horizontal scaling]]


# Maintainability
The way of designing the software the way so it is easy to operate on and evolve
Making lives of the developers easy
