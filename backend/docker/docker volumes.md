Volumes are preferred mechanism for persisting data generated and used by Docker containers.
Unlike [[bind mounts]] that are dependent on the directory structure and OS of the host machine, volumes are completely managed by Docker.

- **Managed by Docker**: Volumes are created, managed, and stored by Docker, typically in `/var/lib/docker/volumes` on the host.
- **Independent of Host Directory Structure**: Since Docker manages them, they are not dependent on the host directory structure.
- **Backup and Restore**: Volumes are easier to back up and restore compared to bind mounts.
- **Access Control**: Volumes provide better isolation since they are managed by Docker, reducing the risk of unintentional modification from the host.

#### Use Cases:

- **Persistent Data Storage**: For databases, configurations, and other data that need to persist across container restarts.
- **Sharing Data Between Containers**: Volumes can be shared and reused among multiple containers.
