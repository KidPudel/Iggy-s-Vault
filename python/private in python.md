Python's approach to encapsulation and "privacy" is based more on convention and the principle of "we're all consenting adults here" rather than strict enforcement.


functions can be made private with
- [[naming styles]] like `_` at the front, what will make it a weak internal (also see [[importing in python]])
- [[closures]]
