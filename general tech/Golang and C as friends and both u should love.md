Using C for side projects will not necessarily make you miss out on Golang experience and skill strengthening. In fact, learning C can directly improve your understanding of Golang and strengthen your overall engineering mindset, given that Golang is heavily influenced by C and its design principles.

Here's why learning C can benefit your Golang skills and overall software engineering abilities:

1. **Fundamental Concepts**: C is a low-level language that ***exposes many fundamental concepts of computer systems***, such as memory management, pointers, and direct hardware interaction. By learning C, you'll gain a deeper understanding of these concepts, which are also relevant in Golang, albeit with higher-level abstractions.

2. **Language Design**: Golang's design is heavily influenced by C, with the goal of combining the simplicity and performance of C with modern language features. By learning C, you'll better appreciate the design decisions and trade-offs made in Golang, as well as the rationale behind certain language features and idioms.

3. **Performance Optimization**: Both C and Golang are known for their performance and efficiency. ***By learning C, you'll develop a better intuition for writing efficient code, optimizing memory usage, and understanding low-level performance considerations,*** which can directly translate to writing more performant Golang code.

4. **Systems Programming**: C is widely used for systems programming, operating systems, and low-level libraries. By gaining experience with C, you'll better understand how these systems work under the hood, which can be valuable when using Golang for systems programming tasks or interacting with C libraries through CGO.

5. **Problem-Solving Skills**: Learning a low-level language like C can improve your problem-solving abilities, as ***it forces you to think more carefully*** about data structures, algorithms, and resource management. ***These skills are transferable to any programming language***, including Golang.
6. ==**Bonus, C is the foundation itself**==

***While learning C, you can continue to practice and improve your Golang skills by working on Golang projects in parallel.*** This approach will allow you to apply the low-level concepts you learn from C while also gaining practical experience with Golang's features, tooling, and ecosystem.

Moreover, many Golang developers have a background in C or C++, as these languages are foundational to systems programming and often serve as prerequisites for learning Golang effectively.

In summary, using C for side projects will not make you miss out on Golang experience. Instead, it will enhance your overall engineering mindset, provide a deeper understanding of low-level concepts, and ultimately make you a better Golang developer by giving you a stronger foundation in the principles and design decisions that influenced Golang's creation.

> C, c++ , and Go that is simple to learn and training your mindset and programming skills. Thanks for quick video but really useful!

# additional motivation
Learning C is good advice for any general software developer **if you do not want to treat your hardware as a magic box**. It will give you some **really good insights about internals, which could be useful for you on your day to day development**. But if you are coming from high levels languages it may become really tricky at first, and tooling is... well it's work in progress. Also prepare to shoot yourself in the foot. A lot. It's good because you learning but can be/will be frustrating.

So - to repeat myself - start with Go. And then, if you really sure about going "low level" or just want **to increase your overall competence - learn C**. Go will expose you to the many aspects while protecting you from long list of headaches. It is likely you will meet C code in your used libraries (sqlite for example) in form of CGO. You don't, however need to read it and understand it at this point.

Plus, jdh uses C for making games

C is harder to pick up, because it has less features, which will make you understand why would you want something like garbage collected pointer and so on, and youll understand why and what are the pitfalls


- Learn **C**, by making a game, C is the foundation that will improve me as a software engineer so much, with that ill **learn fundamentals how computers actually work**, you’ll make a lot of mistakes, but this will actually teach you. This will make you appreciate the things other programmers do, and most importantly _why_ they do it, this will make you a better developer, challenging yourself with a need of deeper knowledge 
- Do **Golang**, because it is a balanced language to accomplish things, in a clean and performant way, therefore making you accomplish things, and make you a great engineer, also this is a great language for backend (very interesting and balanced field)
