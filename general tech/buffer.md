Buffer is the temporary storage area in memory to hold data before processing or transferring it (until computer is ready to handle it). 
In graphics rendering, they are used to store vertex data, color data, texture data, etc. So it is an ***array of unformatted memory allocated for graphics backend to use***

there is a keyboard buffer, if the computer is frizzed, key strokes are recorded to the keyboard buffer, and after computer is responsible, buffer will release all data at once.
