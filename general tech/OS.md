operating system is a software layer between the hardware and other software programs.
It manages the hardware

It consists of:
1. kernel, which is answering system calls from other software and coordinating software with hardware. This is also a place where hardware drivers live, they teach the kernel how to talk with the specific hardware components drivers are written for.
2. APIs that allows to communicate between hardware and software in expedited way (faster)
3. User space or user software.
