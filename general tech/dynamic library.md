Dynamic or shared library a collection of pre-compiled code that multiple programs can use or rather reference at runtime

Unlike [[static library]], dynamic library is not getting linked at compile time, but rather separate **executable gets loaded/referenced into memory and linked at runtime**, so it is not the part of the executable

They typically has `.DLL, .so, .dylib` extension
