Static or *statically linked* library is a collection of pre-compiled external code that a our program will embed in itself.

After compiler generates [[object files]] compiler invokes [[linker]] and this library is getting linked at a compile time, meaning that their code becomes a part of the final executable, unlike [[dynamic library]]

They typically has `.lib .a` extension
